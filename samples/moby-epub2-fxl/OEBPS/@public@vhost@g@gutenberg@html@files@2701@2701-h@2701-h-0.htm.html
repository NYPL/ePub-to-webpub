<h2 id="pgepubid00004">EXTRACTS. (Supplied by a Sub-Sub-Librarian).</h2>
<p>It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of a poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long Vaticans and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random allusions to whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever, sacred or profane. Therefore you must not, in every case at least, take the higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in these extracts, for veritable gospel cetology. Far from it. As touching the ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here appearing, these extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as affording a glancing bird’s eye view of what has been promiscuously said, thought, fancied, and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and generations, including our own.</p>
<p>So fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I am. Thou belongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe which no wine of this world will ever warm; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be too rosy-strong; but with whom one sometimes loves to sit, and feel poor-devilish, too; and grow convivial upon tears; and say to them bluntly, with full eyes and empty glasses, and in not altogether unpleasant sadness—Give it up, Sub-Subs! For by how much the more pains ye take to please the world, by so much the more shall ye for ever go thankless! Would that I could clear out Hampton Court and the Tuileries for ye! But gulp down your tears and hie aloft to the royal-mast with your hearts; for your friends who have gone before are clearing out the seven-storied heavens, and making refugees of long-pampered Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael, against your coming. Here ye strike but splintered hearts together—there, ye shall strike unsplinterable glasses!</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00005">EXTRACTS.</h3>

<p>“And what thing soever besides cometh within the chaos of this monster’s mouth, be it beast, boat, or stone, down it goes all incontinently that foul great swallow of his, and perisheth in the bottomless gulf of his paunch.” —<i>Holland’s Plutarch’s Morals</i>.</p>
<p>“The Indian Sea breedeth the most and the biggest fishes that are: among which the Whales and Whirlpooles called Balaene, take up as much in length as four acres or arpens of land.” —<i>Holland’s Pliny</i>.</p>
<p>“Scarcely had we proceeded two days on the sea, when about sunrise a great many Whales and other monsters of the sea, appeared. Among the former, one was of a most monstrous size.... This came towards us, open-mouthed, raising the waves on all sides, and beating the sea before him into a foam.” —<i>Tooke’s Lucian</i>. “<i>The True History</i>.”</p>
<p>“He visited this country also with a view of catching horse-whales, which had bones of very great value for their teeth, of which he brought some to the king.... The best whales were catched in his own country, of which some were forty-eight, some fifty yards long. He said that he was one of six who had killed sixty in two days.” —<i>Other or Other’s verbal narrative taken down from his mouth by King Alfred, A.D.</i> 890.</p>
<p>“And whereas all the other things, whether beast or vessel, that enter into the dreadful gulf of this monster’s (whale’s) mouth, are immediately lost and swallowed up, the sea-gudgeon retires into it in great security, and there sleeps.” —MONTAIGNE. —<i>Apology for Raimond Sebond</i>.</p>

<br/>     Mote him availle, but to returne againe
<br/>     To his wound’s worker, that with lowly dart,
<br/>     Dinting his breast, had bred his restless paine,
<br/>     Like as the wounded whale to shore flies thro’ the maine.”
<br/>      —<i>The Faerie Queen</i>.
<br/></div>
<p>“Immense as whales, the motion of whose vast bodies can in a peaceful calm trouble the ocean till it boil.” —<i>Sir William Davenant. Preface to Gondibert</i>.</p>
<p>“What spermacetti is, men might justly doubt, since the learned Hosmannus in his work of thirty years, saith plainly, <i>Nescio quid sit</i>.” —<i>Sir T. Browne. Of Sperma Ceti and the Sperma Ceti Whale. Vide his V. E.</i></p>

<br/>     Stretched like a promontory sleeps or swims,
<br/>     And seems a moving land; and at his gills
<br/>     Draws in, and at his breath spouts out a sea.” —<i>Ibid</i>.

<p>“While the whale is floating at the stern of the ship, they cut off his head, and tow it with a boat as near the shore as it will come; but it will be aground in twelve or thirteen feet water.” —<i>Thomas Edge’s Ten Voyages to Spitzbergen, in Purchas</i>.</p>
<p>“In their way they saw many whales sporting in the ocean, and in wantonness fuzzing up the water through their pipes and vents, which nature has placed on their shoulders.” —<i>Sir T. Herbert’s Voyages into Asia and Africa. Harris Coll</i>.</p>
<p>“Here they saw such huge troops of whales, that they were forced to proceed with a great deal of caution for fear they should run their ship upon them.” —<i>Schouten’s Sixth Circumnavigation</i>.</p>
<p>“We set sail from the Elbe, wind N.E. in the ship called The Jonas-in-the-Whale.... Some say the whale can’t open his mouth, but that is a fable.... They frequently climb up the masts to see whether they can see a whale, for the first discoverer has a ducat for his pains.... I was told of a whale taken near Shetland, that had above a barrel of herrings in his belly.... One of our harpooneers told me that he caught once a whale in Spitzbergen that was white all over.” —<i>A Voyage to Greenland, A.D.</i> 1671. <i>Harris Coll</i>.</p>
<p>“Several whales have come in upon this coast (Fife) Anno 1652, one eighty feet in length of the whale-bone kind came in, which (as I was informed), besides a vast quantity of oil, did afford 500 weight of baleen. The jaws of it stand for a gate in the garden of Pitferren.” —<i>Sibbald’s Fife and Kinross</i>.</p>
<p>“Myself have agreed to try whether I can master and kill this Sperma-ceti whale, for I could never hear of any of that sort that was killed by any man, such is his fierceness and swiftness.” —<i>Richard Strafford’s Letter from the Bermudas. Phil. Trans. A.D.</i> 1668.</p>
<p>“Whales in the sea God’s voice obey.” —<i>N. E. Primer</i>.</p>

<p>“... and the breath of the whale is frequently attended with such an insupportable smell, as to bring on a disorder of the brain.” —<i>Ulloa’s South America</i>.</p>

<p>“If you should write a fable for little fishes, you would make them speak like great whales.” —<i>Goldsmith to Johnson</i>.</p>
<p>“In the afternoon we saw what was supposed to be a rock, but it was found to be a dead whale, which some Asiatics had killed, and were then towing ashore. They seemed to endeavor to conceal themselves behind the whale, in order to avoid being seen by us.” —<i>Cook’s Voyages</i>.</p>
<p>“The larger whales, they seldom venture to attack. They stand in so great dread of some of them, that when out at sea they are afraid to mention even their names, and carry dung, lime-stone, juniper-wood, and some other articles of the same nature in their boats, in order to terrify and prevent their too near approach.” —<i>Uno Von Troil’s Letters on Banks’s and Solander’s Voyage to Iceland in</i> 1772.</p>

<p>“A tenth branch of the king’s ordinary revenue, said to be grounded on the consideration of his guarding and protecting the seas from pirates and robbers, is the right to <i>royal</i> fish, which are whale and sturgeon.
